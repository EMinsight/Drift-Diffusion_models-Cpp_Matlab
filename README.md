# Drift-Diffusion_models

The Drift-Diffusion folder contains codes which solve the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion system with several different approaches:
Finite differences, Sharfetter-Gummel, and 5th order weighted essentially nonoscillatory method (WENO5).

The Mott-Gurney_law folder solves the same system in the high field limit where the diffusion term is neglected.
