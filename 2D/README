2D Drift Diffusion 

This solves the semiconductor drift-diffusion equations in 2D for both electrons and holes using finite differences. The equations are Poisson eqn, 
continuity equation, and drift-diffusion equation which are solved in a decoupled iterative method (Gummel method). Scharfetter-Gummel
discretization as well as linear mixing of old and new solutions is used to maintain stability.
